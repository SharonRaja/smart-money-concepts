## Contributing

This project is still in BETA so please feel free to contribute to the project. By creating your own indicators or improving the existing ones. If you are struggling to find something to do then please check out the issues tab for requested changes.

1. Fork it (https://github.com/joshyattridge/smartmoneyconcepts/fork).
2. Study how it's implemented.
3. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature).
4. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature').
5. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature).
6. Create a new Pull Request.

Less is more â€“ each pull request should be minimal, focusing on a single function or a small feature. Large, sweeping changes will not be merged, as they are harder to review and maintain. Keep it simple and focused!
